Northern fur seal pup analysis scripts

This Github includes organized scripts for processing northern fur seal pup data collected on St. Paul Island, AK in the eastern Bering Sea in the fall of 2024. Preprocessing includes merging pup raw accelerometer data with the annotated behavior datasheet to use to build and training supervised machine learning models. This section also includes prepping the data for the model - such as extracting features from the data (including continuous wavelet transform features), binning the data into window sizes, cleaning for NANs, and standardizing the data. The Machine Learning tab includes scripts for generating randomized grid search for the models, training the data with an Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, predicting behaviors with new data using the trained model, and generating a confusion matrix. The Behavior Analysis tab includes scripts to pull all pup behavior frequencies out of the code to generate splines and focus specifically on nursing behavior as well - as it correlates to maternal foraging beahviors. Lastly, the Ecology tab includes a script to run linear models on carbon and nitrogen isotopes for mother and pup pairs, understand the factors that influence growth rate in pups, and further analyze the differences in behavior between pups at different rookeries or pups of different sexes. Most CSVs used in the scripts are generated within other prior scripts loaded here.
